A personal website for a programmer. The site should have a modern and clean design, featuring sections for About, Projects, Skills, and Contact. The color scheme should be sleek, with a preference for cool tones like blues and grays. It should include a portfolio section to showcase programming projects with descriptions, images, and links. The layout should be user-friendly and responsive for different devices. Incorporate a professional-looking font, and ensure the site conveys a tech-savvy and innovative image.
